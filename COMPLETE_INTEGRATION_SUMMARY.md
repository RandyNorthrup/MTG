### 7. **Enhanced UI Components** (`ui/enhanced_card_renderer.py`)
- **✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Advanced card display with P/T, keywords, status
- **✅ VISUAL FEATURES** - Color coding, token indicators, combat keywords
- **✅ READY TO USE** - Import tested and components available

### 8. **Enhanced Card Loading** (`engine/card_fetch.py`)
- **✅ FULLY INTEGRATED** - Card creation uses enhanced validation
- **✅ BACKWARD COMPATIBLE** - Falls back gracefully if systems unavailable
- **✅ TESTED** - Enhanced card creation working in deck loading
