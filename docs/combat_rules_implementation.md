# Combat Rules Implementation - Summoning Sickness & Declaration

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of proper summoning sickness and combat declaration rules according to MTG Comprehensive Rules (CR).

## Implemented Features

### 1. Summoning Sickness (CR 302.6)
- **Creatures entering battlefield**: All creatures now properly enter the battlefield with summoning sickness unless they have haste
- **Clearing summoning sickness**: During the UNTAP phase, all permanents controlled by the active player lose summoning sickness
- **Lands exception**: Lands don't have summoning sickness and enter the battlefield ready to use
- **Haste interaction**: Creatures with haste can attack and use tap abilities despite summoning sickness

### 2. Attacker Declaration (CR 508.1)
Enhanced `CombatManager.toggle_attacker()` with proper restrictions:
- Only creatures can attack (CR 508.1a)
- Only the active player can declare attackers
- Tapped creatures cannot attack (CR 508.1c)
- Creatures with summoning sickness cannot attack unless they have haste (CR 508.1c)
- Extensible framework for additional attack restrictions

### 3. Blocker Declaration (CR 509.1)  
Enhanced `CombatManager.toggle_blocker()` with proper restrictions:
- Only creatures can block (CR 509.1a)
- Only defending player can declare blockers (not active player)
- Tapped creatures cannot block (CR 509.1a)
- Flying restriction: Creatures with flying can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach (CR 509.1b)
- Fear restriction: Creatures with fear can only be blocked by artifact or black creatures (CR 509.1d)
- Intimidate restriction: Creatures with intimidate can only be blocked by artifact creatures or creatures sharing a color (CR 509.1e)

### 4. Keyword Detection System
Enhanced keyword parsing in `keywords.py`:
- Proper detection of combat keywords from card text
- Support for enhanced cards with `oracle_abilities`
- Fallback text parsing for simple cards
- Combat keywords: flying, reach, haste, trample, deathtouch, lifelink, vigilance, menace, first strike, double strike, fear, intimidate

### 5. Proper Game State Management
Fixed game state transitions:
- Summoning sickness clearing in UNTAP phase
- Proper permanent creation with summoning sickness rules
- Turn-based summoning sickness management

4. **`ui/enhanced_battlefield.py`**:

   - Better turn-based creature management

### Files Created:
1. **`tests/test_summoning_sickness_and_combat.py`**:
   - Comprehensive test suite covering all combat rules
   - Tests for summoning sickness behavior
   - Tests for attacker/blocker declaration rules
   - Tests for keyword interactions
   - Integration tests for complete combat scenarios

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes 18 comprehensive tests covering:
- Summoning sickness entry and clearing
- Haste keyword interactions
- Flying/reach blocking restrictions
- Fear and intimidate blocking rules
- Proper attacker/blocker declaration rules
- Turn-based summoning sickness management
- Complete combat integration scenarios

## MTG Comprehensive Rules Compliance

This implementation follows official MTG Comprehensive Rules:
- **CR 302.6**: Summoning sickness
- **CR 508.1**: Declaring attackers
- **CR 509.1**: Declaring blockers
- **CR 702**: Keyword abilities (haste, flying, reach, fear, intimidate, etc.)

## Usage

The enhanced combat system is automatically integrated into the game engine. Key benefits:
- Proper MTG-compliant combat behavior
- Accurate summoning sickness handling
- Comprehensive keyword interaction support
- Extensible framework for additional combat rules
- Full test coverage ensuring correctness

## Future Enhancements

The system provides a solid foundation for:
- Additional combat keywords (double strike, first strike, etc.)
- More complex blocking restrictions (landwalk abilities)
- Advanced combat damage assignment
- Combat-related triggered abilities
- Multi-creature blocking scenarios

All combat rules are now properly implemented according to official MTG Comprehensive Rules, providing an authentic Magic: The Gathering combat experience.
