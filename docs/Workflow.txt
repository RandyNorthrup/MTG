Basic workflow we can use

You (or I) create a feature branch:

git checkout -b feature/tabbed-ui-polish


Make edits, commit, and push:

git add -A
git commit -m "Polish tabbed UI; fix commander tax typing; hash-safe playable check"
git push -u origin feature/tabbed-ui-polish


Open a Pull Request on GitHub → I’ll review and propose changes.

Merge to main when green.

To get updates locally:

git pull --rebase

Recommended ignores (keep the repo lean)

You already have a .gitignore, but to be safe, ensure these are covered—especially the large card DBs:

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
.env

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Data (big files not needed in repo)
data/cards/card_db_full.json
data/cards/input_bulk_default_cards.json
data/cards/*.zip


If you do want to version big files (e.g., a curated card_db_full.json), use Git LFS:

git lfs install
git lfs track "data/cards/*.json"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track card DBs with LFS"
git push
