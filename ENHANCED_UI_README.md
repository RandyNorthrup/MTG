## 🔧 Technical Details

### Integration Points
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: If enhanced components fail, legacy versions are used
- **Engine Integration**: All components work with existing GameAppAPI
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and memory usage
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing saves and decks

### API Extensions
The `GameAppAPI` has been extended with methods for enhanced lobby:
- `get_players()` - Get current players
- `get_available_decks()` - List deck files
- `refresh_matches()` - Get available matches  
- `create_match()` - Create new matches
- `join_match()` - Join existing matches

### Theme System
All components use the centralized theme from `ui/theme.py`:
- Consistent colors and styling
- Easy customization
- Professional appearance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Enhanced lobby not loading:**
```bash
# Check if all files are present
python test_enhanced_integration.py
```

**Import errors:**

pip install PySide6
```

**Performance issues:**
```bash
# Use the optimized launcher
python launch_enhanced.py
```

### Fallback Behavior
- If enhanced components fail, the application falls back to legacy UI
