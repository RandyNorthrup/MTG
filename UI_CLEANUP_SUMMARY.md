# Enhanced Game Board UI Cleanup

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

Based on your marked screenshot, I've cleaned up the following redundant UI elements:

### ❌ **Removed Redundant Elements:**

1. **"Pass Priority" Button** - Removed from top control panel
   - This was inappropriate for the main UI controls
   - Priority passing is handled automatically by the game engine

2. **"Resolve Stack" Button** - Removed from top control panel  
   - This duplicated functionality in the stack widget
   - Stack resolution should be handled through proper game flow

3. **"Mulligan" Button** - Removed from top control panel
   - Mulligan functionality belongs in game setup, not active play
   - This was showing inappropriately during normal gameplay

4. **Duplicate "Resolve" and "Clear" Buttons** - Simplified in stack widget
   - Removed redundant stack control buttons
   - Stack now shows informational text instead

### ✅ **Kept Essential Elements:**

- **"Next Phase" Button** - Main phase advancement control
- **Phase Indicator** - Shows current game phase and active player  
- **Life Counters** - Player life management with +/- buttons
- **Mana Pool** - Visual mana tracking
- **Battlefield Zones** - Card display areas
- **Game Log** - Action history
- **Hand Display** - Player's cards

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Top Panel Cleanup** (`create_top_panel()`)
```python
# Before: Multiple redundant buttons
controls_row1 = [Next Phase] [Pass Priority]  
controls_row2 = [Resolve Stack] [Mulligan]

# After: Clean, essential controls
controls_row = [Next Phase]
```

### 2. **Stack Widget Simplification** (`StackWidget`)
```python
# Before: Redundant action buttons
[Resolve] [Clear]

# After: Informational text
"Stack resolves from top to bottom"
```

## 🎨 **Visual Impact**

### Before:
- Cluttered top panel with 4 inappropriate buttons
- Confusing duplicate controls
- Stack widget had redundant resolution buttons
- Poor user experience with unclear button purposes

### After:  
- Clean, focused interface
- Single "Next Phase" button for main control
- Stack widget shows information instead of duplicate controls
- Professional appearance matching MTG software standards
