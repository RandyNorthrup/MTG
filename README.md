### Development Workflow

#### Code Style Guidelines
- **Type hints** for all function parameters and returns
- **Docstrings** for all public methods and classes
- **PEP 8** styling (use `black` and `isort`)
- **Descriptive names** for variables and functions
- **Small, focused functions** (single responsibility)

#### Adding New Card Mechanics

1. **Define the Ability Structure**
```python
# In engine/abilities_system.py
class NewKeywordAbility(KeywordAbility):
    def __init__(self, parameter):
        super().__init__("New Keyword")
        self.parameter = parameter
    
    def apply_effect(self, game_state, source):
        # Implement the mechanic
        pass
```

2. **Add Parsing Logic**
```python
# In engine/rules_engine.py
def parse_new_keyword(text: str):
    pattern = r'new keyword (\\d+)'
    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
    if match:
        return NewKeywordAbility(int(match.group(1)))
    return None
```

3. **Add Tests**
```python
# In tests/test_card_mechanics.py
def test_new_keyword_ability(self):
    card = Card(id="test", name="Test Card", types=["Creature"], 
                mana_cost=2, text="New keyword 3")
    
    abilities = parse_oracle_text(card.text)
    self.assertEqual(len(abilities), 1)
    self.assertIsInstance(abilities[0], NewKeywordAbility)
```
